# Codex App Parity Skill

Use this skill for any feature work or user-visible behavior/UI change in this repository.
Do not use it for purely internal refactors that do not affect behavior.

## Objective

Ensure behavior is implemented with Codex.app as the source of truth, then verified with headless Playwright and screenshots.

## Project Instructions

## Codex.app-First Development Policy

For every **new feature** and every **behavior/UI change**, treat the installed desktop app as the source of truth:

- App path: `/Applications/Codex.app`
- Primary bundle to inspect: `/Applications/Codex.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar`

Do not implement first and compare later. Compare first, then implement.

## How to Search for Features in Codex.app

### Extraction

Extract the app bundle once (reuse if already extracted):

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/codex-app-extracted
npx asar extract "/Applications/Codex.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar" /tmp/codex-app-extracted
```

### Key Directories

| Directory | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| `/tmp/codex-app-extracted/webview/assets/` | Main frontend bundle (`index-*.js`) + locale files |
| `/tmp/codex-app-extracted/.vite/build/` | Electron main process (`main.js`, `main-*.js`, `preload.js`, `worker.js`) |
| `/tmp/codex-app-extracted/package.json` | App metadata, version, entry point |

### Searching the Minified Bundle

The main UI bundle is a single large minified JS file at `webview/assets/index-*.js`. Use Python to search since `grep -o` with large repeat counts fails on macOS:

```python
python3 -c "
with open('/tmp/codex-app-extracted/webview/assets/index-<hash>.js', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
idx = content.find('YOUR_SEARCH_TERM')
if idx >= 0:
    print(content[max(0, idx-200):idx+500])
"
```

### What to Search For

1. **i18n keys**: Search locale files (`webview/assets/zh-TW-*.js`, `webview/assets/en-*.js`, etc.) for human-readable labels. Keys follow the pattern `component.feature.property` (e.g., `composer.dictation.tooltip`).

2. **Component functions**: Minified React components follow patterns like `function X4n({prop1:t,prop2:e,...})`. Search for the feature's i18n key to find the component that renders it.

3. **API calls and endpoints**: Search main process files (`.vite/build/main-*.js`) for endpoint URLs, auth handling, and IPC channels. Key patterns:
   - `prodApiBaseUrl` → production API base (e.g., `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api`)
   - `devApiBaseUrl` → dev API base (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/api`)
   - `fetch-request` / `fetch-response` → IPC-proxied HTTP calls from renderer to main process

4. **Icon names**: Search for icon imports like `audiowave-dark.svg`, `book-open-dark.svg`. Icon mapping is in the main bundle around the `Hwn=Object.assign({` pattern.

5. **Keyboard shortcuts**: Search for `CmdOrCtrl+`, `Cmd+`, `keydown`, `keyCode`, or specific key names.

### Search Strategy

1. Start with **i18n locale files** — they have human-readable labels that identify features.
2. Use the i18n key to find the **component** in the main bundle.
3. Trace the component to find **hooks/composables**, **API calls**, and **event handlers**.
4. Check the **main process** bundle for any server-side proxying or Electron IPC handling.

### Architecture Notes

- **Renderer → Main Process**: The renderer uses a `Uu` HTTP client class that sends `fetch-request` IPC messages to the main process. The main process class `tle` handles these, adds auth tokens, and uses `electron.net.fetch` to make actual HTTP calls.
- **Auth**: Auth tokens come from the app-server's `getAuthStatus` RPC method (ChatGPT backend auth).
- **App-server**: A `codex app-server` child process communicating via JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout. Our bridge middleware proxies RPC calls to it.
- **Config constants**: `R7` = prodApiBaseUrl (`https://chatgpt.com/backend-api`), `I7` = devApiBaseUrl (`http://localhost:8000/api`), `C7` = originator (`Codex Desktop`).

## Required Workflow (Feature Work)

1. Identify target behavior:
- Restate what behavior is being added/changed.
- Define whether it is: data mapping, runtime event handling, UX text, visual treatment, interaction model, or all of these.

2. Inspect Codex.app before coding:
- Locate the implementation in `app.asar` (extract and search built assets as needed).
- Find relevant strings/keys/functions/components for the feature (status labels, event names, item types, summaries, collapse/expand behavior, etc.).
- Capture the closest equivalent pattern if exact parity is not present.

3. Build a parity checklist from Codex.app:
- Data model shape (fields used by UI).
- Realtime event sources and transitions.
- Rendering structure (what is shown collapsed vs expanded).
- Copy/text behavior (phrasing and status wording).
- Interaction behavior (auto-expand, auto-collapse, click/keyboard handling).
- Visibility rules (when elements appear/disappear).

4. Implement against that checklist:
- Prefer Codex.app behavior over novel design.
- Keep deviations minimal and intentional.
- If deviating, include a short reason in the final response.

5. Verify parity after implementation:
- Confirm each checklist item.
- Run local build/tests.
- Re-check UI behavior against Codex.app reference.

## Response Requirements (When delivering feature changes)

For feature tasks, include:

- `Codex.app analysis`: what was inspected (files/areas/patterns).
- `Parity result`: matched items and any explicit deviations.
- `Fallback note` only if Codex.app could not be inspected or had no equivalent.

## Fallback Rules

If Codex.app cannot be inspected (missing app, extraction/search failure) or has no equivalent pattern:

- State the blocker explicitly.
- Use best local implementation consistent with existing repository patterns.
- Keep behavior conservative and avoid speculative UX innovations.

## Scope and Safety

- This policy applies to **feature behavior and UX decisions**, not just styling.
- Bug fixes should still check Codex.app when they affect user-visible behavior.
- Prefer minimal patches that align with app behavior rather than large refactors.

## Completion Verification Requirement

- After completing a task that changes behavior or UI, always run a Playwright verification in **headless** mode.
- Always capture a screenshot of the changed result and display that screenshot in chat when reporting completion.

## Self-Improvement Protocol

After each feature implementation session that uses this skill:

1. **Record new findings**: Append a dated `## Findings:` section documenting any newly discovered Codex.app internals (state keys, API endpoints, component patterns, auth flows, etc.).
2. **Update search instructions**: If new search techniques were used (e.g., a better way to extract minified code, new file locations), update the "How to Search for Features" section.
3. **Update architecture notes**: If new IPC channels, API endpoints, or data flows were discovered, add them to the Architecture Notes.
4. **Keep findings actionable**: Each finding should include enough detail that a future session can reuse it without re-discovering.

## Findings: Workspace Root Ordering (2026-02-25)

- Codex.app persists workspace root ordering/labels in global state JSON keys:
  - `electron-saved-workspace-roots` (order source of truth)
  - `electron-workspace-root-labels`
  - `active-workspace-roots`
- In this environment, persisted file path is:
  - `~/.codex/.codex-global-state.json`
- In packaged desktop runs, equivalent userData path is typically:
  - `~/Library/Application Support/Codex/.codex-global-state.json`
- For folder/project reorder parity, prefer reading these keys over browser LocalStorage-only ordering.
- Validation requirement for reorder changes:
  - Run build/typecheck.
  - Run Playwright in headless mode and capture a screenshot showing sidebar order.

## Findings: Dictation / Microphone Feature (2026-02-26)

- **i18n keys**: `composer.dictation.*` — tooltip is "Hold to dictate", aria is "Dictate".
- **Component**: `M4n` React hook handles recording state, audio capture, and transcription.
- **Audio pipeline**: `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: { channelCount: 1 } })` → `MediaRecorder` → chunks → `Blob` → multipart POST.
- **Transcription endpoint**: The renderer sends audio to `/transcribe` via the IPC fetch proxy. The main process (`tle` class) prepends the `prodApiBaseUrl` (`https://chatgpt.com/backend-api`) and attaches ChatGPT auth bearer tokens. Full URL: `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/transcribe`.
- **Request format**: Multipart form-data with boundary `----codex-transcribe-<uuid>`, fields: `file` (audio blob) and optional `language`. Body is base64-encoded and sent with `X-Codex-Base64: 1` header.
- **Response**: `{ text: "transcribed text" }`.
- **Interaction model**: Press-and-hold to record → release to stop and transcribe → text inserted into composer. Has "insert" and "send" modes.
- **Icon**: `audiowave-dark.svg` / `audiowave-light.svg` (custom SVG, not from icon library).
- **Web app implementation**: Our bridge proxies `/codex-api/transcribe` to the ChatGPT backend using auth tokens from the app-server `getAuthStatus` RPC. Frontend uses `useDictation` composable with `MediaRecorder` API.
